    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
   // REFERENCE TO THE ORIGINAL array

    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Darky';
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'roar';
    console.log(team4)

    // OR 
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
        // REFERENCE TO THE ORIGINAL OBJECT

      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 9;
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const steve = {
      name: 'Steve',
      age: 24,
      social: {
        ig: '@steve.antonio_',
        facebook: 'Steve Marquez'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(steve);

    // make a copy of it
    // it will only work for 1D objects, not nested ones when you are trying to assing new key-value pairs
    const dev = Object.assign({}, steve);
    // cheating way of doing it - poors man deep clone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(steve));
